create a new page for iklectik events
import text and images
typescript for data

https://www.wpgraphql.com/docs/wpgraphql-vs-wp-rest-api 

proposal: a pay-as-you go thing
- first phase would be building and deploying what data I can get access to from graphql api
    - requires them to instal the graphql plugin
    - I'd have to look at the design to give an estimate on time

optional
- paypal integration
- shopify frontend with the storefront API

- second phase could be moving to a different CMS, potentially a custom one built in Sanity
